# Welcome to my portfolio!

You get to see all the guts behind my website. 

## Summary
This website took about 2 years to make. I struggled with 
learning React almost entirely on my own. Through my internship
and various projects for my classes at Georgia Tech,
I'm proud to present the culmination of my learnings
as a full-stack webapp developer. 

## Stack
- Django back-end
- React front-end
- Hosted on AWS Lightsail
- DNS Hosted with AWS Route 53
